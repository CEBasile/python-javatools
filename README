== Overview ==

A simple Java Class file unpacking and inspecting module.


The end result of which should be the ability to write a short script with
output identical to the variations of javap as included with most SDKs.



== Scripts Installed ==

classdiff

  attempts to find differences between two Java class files


classinfo

  similar to the javap utility included with most JVMs


jardiff

  prints the deltas between the contents of a JAR, and runs classdiff
  on differing Java class files contained in the JARs
