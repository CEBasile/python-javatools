== Overview ==

A simple Java Class file unpacking and inspecting module.


The end result of which should be the ability to write a short script with
output identical to the variations of javap as included with most SDKs.



== Scripts Installed ==


classinfo

  similar to the javap utility included with most JVMs. Also does
  provides/requires tracking.


classdiff

  attempts to find differences between two Java class files


jarinfo

  prints information about a JAR. Also does provides/requires
  tracking.


jardiff

  prints the deltas between the contents of a JAR, and runs classdiff
  on differing Java class files contained in the JARs


manifest

  creates and verifies class checksum manifests


distinfo

  prints information about a mixed multi-jar/class distribution, such
  as provides/requires lists.


distdiff

  attempts to find differences between two distributions,
  deep-checking any JARs or Java class files found in either
  directory.
