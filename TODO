- move the pretty_* methods out of __init__.py and into javap.py or
  some-such.

- create bin script wrappers for classdiff and (maybe) javap, though
  the latter may be too much of a potential conflict with existing
  installations of JVMs, etc. Perhaps it'll install as pavaj or
  something ridiculous as that to avoid the conflict.

- expand the verbosity of classdiff

- perhaps diff-like opcode output? That would be a bit of an
  undertaking; would it be at all worth it?
