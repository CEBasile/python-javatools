- standardize on use of pretty_* named functions and methods

- perhaps diff-like opcode output for method code? That would be a bit
  of an undertaking; would it be at all worth it?

- a class or class-member attribute discovery script

- switch to using logging instead of print statements for CLI output
  (bad idea?)

- fill in more docstrings with meaningful explanations

- options to classinfo and jarinfo to attempt to fulfill dependencies
  (possibly recursively) from discoverable locations (JAVA_HOME,
  CLASSPATH, etc) and output missing deps

- write a jarsign verifier, and add signature information to jarinfo.

- make manifest --verify actually do something

- full classinfo --json support

- move JarChange to use a JarInfo instance rather than path name

- move DistChange to use a DistInfo instance rather than path name

- flesh out the cheetah templates for classdiff reports

- generics type signature handling

- default annotation value attribute

- pomdiff? maven-repo-diff?

- [silly] output class files from classinfo data

- [silly] implement jar signing capabilities
