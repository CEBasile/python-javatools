- move the pretty_* methods out of __init__.py and into classinfo.py or
  some-such.

- perhaps diff-like opcode output for method code? That would be a bit
  of an undertaking; would it be at all worth it?

- make jardiff understand META-INF magic files

- a class or class-member attribute discovery script

- switch to using logging instead of print statements for output (bad idea?)

- fill in more docstrings with meaningful explanations

- options to classinfo and jarinfo to attempt to fulfill dependencies
  (possibly recursively) from discoverable locations (JAVA_HOME,
  CLASSPATH, etc) and output missing deps

- write a jarsign verifier, and add signature information to jarinfo

- html/js wrapper for *diff tools using the --json outputs. Maybe
  using jquery? Some kind of nice human readable and interactive
  report display

- classinfo --json support

- move JarChange to use a JarInfo instance rather than path name

- move DistChange to use a DistInfo instance rather than path name

- pomdiff? maven-repo-diff?
