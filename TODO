- move the pretty_* methods out of __init__.py and into javap.py or
  some-such.

- expand the verbosity of classdiff

- perhaps diff-like opcode output for method code? That would be a bit
  of an undertaking; would it be at all worth it?

- make jardiff understand META-INF magic files

- make jardiff work transparently with exploded jars (dirdelta and
  zipdelta need to work together)

- give jardiff a meaningful return code

- an class or class-member attribute discovery script

- switch to using logging instead of print statements for output

- dependency discovery ie: given a class or set of classes generate
  the list of classes and members expected

- fill in more docstrings with meaningful explanations
